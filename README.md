Pourbaix Diagram Construction - Python Scripts

Overview
The Python scripts in this set are designed for the construction and analysis of Pourbaix diagrams in electrochemical systems. The scripts' primary objective is to visualize the stability regions of different species in the system. This is achieved through thermodynamic calculations that involve Gibbs free energy changes. The utilization of these diagrams facilitates the assessment of the potential-pH relationships of metal species and their respective stability, particularly in the presence of various environmental anions, such as chloride, sulfate, and carbonate, as well as different solid and dissolved metal species.
